# patch level of 3.0.0 or later implies Wrath of the Lich King
patch=3.0.0

# Lag is a random value centered on the value below with a range of +/- 0.05 seconds
lag=0.2

# Boss Level
target_level=83

# One of "max_time" (fight time in seconds) or "target_health" must be specified.
# When "max_time" is used, the health of the target will be infered half-way through simulation.
max_time=300

# While min/max damage effects (such as weapons and direct damage spells) are averaged out, spell event
# and attack table mechanics are still random.  In order to get a trustworthy answer from the simulator,
# one must have a very long fight or iterate a short fight many, many times.  Given the constraints of
# mana, iterating a short fight is often more realistic.
iterations=1000

# For convenience it is possible to tell the simulator that a specific resource (mana, rage, etc)
# will never run out if you do not wish to configure raid/consumable buff scenarios to ensure sufficient
# resource replenishment.
infinite_mana=0

# Since support for the Warrior class does not yet exist, one can infer a Sunder Armor debuff by 
# artificially setting a low target armor value.
target_armor=4000

# Since support for the Paladin class does not yet exist, one can speficy target debuffs (such as
# Judgement of Wisdom) and player buffs (such as Blessing of Wisdom and Sanctity Aura) as parameters.
# Both blessing_of_wisdom=1 and sanctity_aura=1 would be included in each player section as appropriate.
judgement_of_wisdom=1

# Enhancement Shaman
#
# (1) The "main_1" option to windfury_weapon puts the enchant only on the main-hand weapon
# (2) The "off_1" option to flametongue_weapon puts the enchant only on the off-hand weapon
# (3) The "maelstrom_5" option to lightning_bolt means that LB will only be executed when there is a 5-stack of Maelstrom Weapon,
#     making the LB cast instant which prevents auto_attack resets.
# (4) The tool accepts separate value for hit/crit even though WotLK has merged them.
