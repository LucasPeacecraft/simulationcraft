# Boss Level
target_level=83

# One of "max_time" (fight time in seconds) or "target_health" must be specified.
# When "max_time" is used, the health of the target will be infered half-way through simulation.
max_time=360

# While min/max damage effects (such as weapons and direct damage spells) are averaged out, spell event
# and attack table mechanics are still random.  In order to get a trustworthy answer from the simulator,
# one must have a very long fight or iterate a short fight many, many times.  Given the constraints of
# mana, iterating a short fight is often more realistic.
iterations=1000

# For convenience it is possible to tell the simulator that a specific resource (mana, rage, etc)
# will never run out if you do not wish to configure raid/consumable buff scenarios to ensure sufficient
# resource replenishment.

# WotLK has regen ticks occuring every 0.1sec.  Modeling this exactly produces a ton of churn in the

# Some WotLK beta patches have included a Potion Sickness debuff that only lows one potion consumed per combat.

# Since support for the Warrior class does not yet exist, one can infer a Sunder Armor debuff by 
# artificially setting a low target armor value.  I'm really not sure what to put here.  I imagine
# that WotLK bosses will have armor close to 10k......  (5x Sunder is 3600 penetration in WotLK)
target_armor=6400

# Since support for the Paladin class does not yet exist, one can specify target debuffs (such as
# Judgement of Wisdom) and player buffs (such as Blessing of Wisdom and Sanctified Retribution) as parameters.
# Both blessing_of_wisdom=1 and sanctified_retribution=1 would be included in each player section as appropriate.
